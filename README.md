🚀 Getting Started

Clone the AI engine:
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-movies-recommendation-system.git

Install AI dependencies:
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Train the AI model:
bashCopypython train_ai_model.py

Launch the recommendation engine:
bashCopypython ai_recommender.py


💡 AI Model Usage Example
pythonCopyfrom ai_movie_recommender import AIMovieRecommender

recommender = AIMovieRecommender()
user_id = 12345
mood = "excited"
recommendations = recommender.get_ai_recommendations(user_id, mood)

print("Top 5 AI-powered movie recommendations for your current mood:")
for movie in recommendations[:5]:
    print(f"- {movie['title']} ({movie['year']}) - AI Confidence: {movie['ai_confidence']}%")
🧠 AI Architecture
Our system employs a sophisticated ensemble of AI models:

Deep Neural Networks: For complex pattern recognition in user behavior.
Natural Language Processing: To understand and process user queries and movie descriptions.
Computer Vision: Analyzes movie visuals to understand style preferences.
Reinforcement Learning: Continuously improves recommendations based on user feedback.
